This is a fun quiz that will not only challenge your knowledge of the popular TV Series on Adult swim
Rick and Morty but will give you a brief overview of web development using Angular JS 1 and NodeJS
I plan to use this app on an on going series on youtube to talk about Client-side development with fun and engaging
tutorials.
